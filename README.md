##  1. Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a **multi-environment infrastructure** using:

- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible** for configuration management  
- **Nginx** to host a static portfolio website

Three separate environments are set up:
- `dev` (Development)
- `stg` (Staging)
- `prod` (Production)

###  This setup ensures:
-  Faster onboarding of environments  
-  Consistent deployment pipelines  
-  Minimal manual intervention  
-  Clear environment segregation

##  2. Project Architecture


![Architecture Overview](Project-desgin.gif)


The architecture enables a **DevOps Engineer** to manage and scale infrastructure from a central system, using:

- A single **Terraform module structure** to provision multiple environments  
- **Ansible inventory files** (`dev`, `stg`, `prod`) for executing targeted configurations  
- Independent configuration states for each environment to maintain **isolation and control**

 *See project diagram for visual reference (available in repo).*

##  3. Tech Stack Used

###  Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Terraform**
  - Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Remote state support (optional)
  - Reusable module pattern

###  Configuration Management
- **Ansible**
  - Environment-specific inventory files
  - Role-based Nginx configuration
  - SSH-based orchestration

###  Web Hosting
- **Nginx**
  - Serves static HTML portfolio
  - Managed via Ansible

###  Cloud Platform
- **AWS**
  - EC2 instances per environment
  - S3 Bucket
  - DynamoDB

###  Developer Environment
- **Ubuntu**
  - Git, Terraform, and Ansible installed
  - CLI-based operations

##  4. Conclusion

This project establishes a **modular, scalable, and environment-driven** infrastructure setup using **Terraform and Ansible**, following DevOps best practices.

### Key Takeaways:
- Clear segregation and reproducibility across environments  
- All setup is defined and managed as code  
- Easily extensible with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, TLS setup, and more

> This architecture is a solid foundation for modern web deployments and automation-first infrastructure management.
